NOTE: To prevent permission errors, do not launch the installer from the Favorites folder.

8.	Choose whether to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. We recommend not adding Anaconda to the PATH environment variable, since this can interfere with other software. Instead, use Anaconda software by opening Anaconda Navigator or the Anaconda Prompt from the Start Menu.
 

9.	Choose whether to register Anaconda as your default Python. Unless you plan on installing and running multiple versions of Anaconda, or multiple versions of Python, accept the default and leave this box checked.
10.	Click the Install button. If you want to watch the packages Anaconda is installing, click Show Details.
11.	Click the Next button.
12.	Optional: To install VS Code, click the Install Microsoft VS Code button. After the install completes click the Next button.
 

Or to install Anaconda without VS Code, click the Skip button.
NOTE: Installing VS Code with the Anaconda installer requires an internet connection. Offline users may be able to find an offline VS Code installer from Microsoft.
13.	After a successful installation you will see the “Thanks for installing Anaconda” dialog box:
 

14.	If you wish to read more about Anaconda Cloud and how to get started with Anaconda, check the boxes “Learn more about Anaconda Cloud” and “Learn how to get started with Anaconda”. Click the Finish button.
15.	After your install is complete, verify it by opening Anaconda Navigator, a program that is included with Anaconda: from your Windows Start menu, select the shortcut Anaconda Navigator. If Navigator opens, you have successfully installed Anaconda. If not, check that you completed each step above, then see our Help page.
